# Intent Prompts

Intent Prompts is a local-first Chrome extension that helps you create, refine, and save high-quality prompts by asking the right questions first.

You lead the intent.  
AI handles the refinement.  
Nothing leaves your device.

## What Intent Prompts Does

Most prompt tools assume you already know exactly what to ask.  
In reality, prompts evolve as your intent becomes clearer.

Intent Prompts works differently:

1. You start with a rough idea
2. The AI asks focused clarifying questions
3. You answer only what matters
4. Intent Prompts produces a complete, high-quality prompt

No presets. No sliders. No noise.

Prompts are treated as living artifacts, not static templates.

## Key Principles

- **Local-only**  
  All prompts are stored locally in your browser. No servers. No accounts.

- **Bring your own API key**  
  You choose the AI provider. You control billing and usage.

- **Minimal by design**  
  No overwhelming controls. You stay in charge.

- **Not a chat wrapper**  
  Intent Prompts helps you figure out what to ask before anything is generated.

## Privacy and Data Storage

Intent Prompts does not collect or transmit your data.

Important things to know:

- All prompts are stored locally in your browser
- No data is synced or backed up anywhere
- No analytics or tracking
- No accounts required

**If you remove the extension, all stored prompts will be permanently deleted.**

If you want to keep important prompts, export or copy them before uninstalling.
